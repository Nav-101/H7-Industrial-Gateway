## ⚡ Power Distribution Network (PDN) & Protection

The power subsystem is designed to provide stable, low-noise rails while ensuring hardware longevity through multi-stage industrial protection. 

### 1. Input Protection and Source Management
The board features a dual-input architecture supporting both a DC Jack (unregulated) and USB-C (VBUS).
* **Primary Protection:** The DC input includes a surface-mount fuse (**F1**) and a transient voltage suppressor (**D5**) to protect against overcurrent and high-voltage spikes.
* **Power Multiplexing (TPS2113A):** A dedicated power mux (**U2**) manages the transition between the DC input and USB power. It prevents back-feeding and ensures a seamless 5V supply to the downstream regulators.

### 2. Multi-Stage Voltage Regulation
The design utilizes a hierarchical approach to down-conversion to optimize efficiency and noise performance:
* **Intermediate Rail (AP63205):** A synchronous buck converter (**U1**) steps down the primary DC input to a stable $5\text{V}$ rail.
* **Digital System Rails (TLV62569):** Two high-frequency synchronous buck converters (**U5**, **U6**) generate the $3.3\text{V}$ I/O rail and the $1.2\text{V}$ STM32 core rail. These are sized to handle high-frequency switching loads from the FMC bus and the Cortex-M7 core.
* **Precision Analog Rail (LP5907):** To ensure the integrity of the 24-bit ADC and Audio Codec, an **LP5907** ultra-low-noise LDO (**U8**) is used to derive a dedicated ($3.3\text{V}$) analog supply ($3\text{V3\_ANA}$).

### 3. Signal Integrity and ESD Protection
* **USB-C Interface:** The USB data lines ($D+/D-$) and Configuration Channel ($CC$) lines are protected by **TPD2EUSB30** ESD suppressor arrays (**D3**, **D4**). 
* **Common Mode Filtering:** A common-mode choke (**L2**) is implemented on the USB differential pair to mitigate EMI.
* **Noise Isolation:** A ferrite bead (**L5**) and dedicated decoupling network isolate the analog power domain from high-frequency digital switching noise.
